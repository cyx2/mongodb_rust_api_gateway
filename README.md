# Welcome to hello_rust

This is an application being built from scratch, that is being used to test AI software engineering tooling and processes. Nearly all code written in this repo is / will be written by agentic coding tools. Current stack is OpenAI Codex (web, cli), and Github Copilot (ide).

## Documentation

All product specs, environment requirements, development workflow details, and engineering conventions live in `AGENTS.md`. Start there for:
- MongoDB CRUD gateway requirements and error contracts
- Environment variable expectations and `.env` usage
- Local setup, debugging tips, and required cargo commands

`README.md` intentionally stays lightweight for quick orientation; contributors should treat `AGENTS.md` as the authoritative handbook.
